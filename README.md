# Timetable Widget

I recently started taking classes again and had to refer to a screenshot of a time table to know which notes to pack. Most organization apps are too complicated, I just want a simple but aesthetic widget that displays the subjects for the day. The application is going to be created using Flutter. No database is required since the information will be persisted in local storage.
